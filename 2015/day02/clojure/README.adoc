Run with

[source,bash]
----
clj -M solution.clj
----

Quite a different solution than the Java one.
Not focussing on a structure but the elements only frees up some brain resources to think what the actual task is.

NOTE: Tested with `1.10.2.774`
      Correct solutions are: `1606483` and `3842356`.
