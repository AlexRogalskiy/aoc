Very simple math, though.
The solution is very much written by me, a person biased to object oriented programming, creating types for just everything.

All the attributes of the parcel the elves need to wrap can be attached to a JEP384 Java record:

[source,java]
----
record Present(int l, int w, int h) {

    int surfaceArea() {
        return 2 * (l * w + w * h + h * l);
    }

    // etc.
}
----

NOTE: Tested with `java version "15.0.1" 2020-10-20`.
      Run with: `java --enable-preview --source 15 Solution.java` or use jbang.
      Correct solutions are: `1606483` and `3842356`.
