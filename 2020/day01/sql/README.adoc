:tags: SQL, MariaDB

SQL based solution, like shooting fish in a barrel.
Hardest part was to make enable `local_infile` on MariaDB respectively MySQL to
load the data easily.

Anyway, finding the combination of values that sum up to 2020 is completely trivial:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT i1.value * i2.value  AS starOne
FROM input i1 CROSS JOIN input i2
WHERE i1.value + i2.value = 2020;
----

I guess you can guess the idea for 3 values matching up 2020?

You need either a locally running MariaDB instance to execute `solution.sql` or 
you run the following script that brings up docker, runs the solution and removes
the container again.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
docker run --name maria --volume=$(pwd):/aoc -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes -e MYSQL_USER=aoc -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret -e MYSQL_DATABASE=aoc -d mariadb:10.3
sleep 10
docker exec -w /aoc -it maria /bin/bash -c  "mysql -uaoc -psecret aoc --local-infile=1 < solution.sql"
docker rm --force maria
----

NOTE: Tested with `MariaDB-1:10.3.27`
      Correct solutions are: `1010299` and `42140160`.
