Interesting pieces here are the `switch` expressions, a bit of https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Advanced_Java/Bitwise_Operators[bit shifting] that 
I hardly do in my day to day job and an implementation of a combinations algorithm.

NOTE: Tested with `java version "15.0.1" 2020-10-20`.
      Run with: `java --enable-preview --source 15 Solution.java`.
      Correct solutions are: `12610010960049` and `3608464522781`.
