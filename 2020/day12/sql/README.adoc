:tags: SQL, MariaDB

== https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12[Rain Risk]

A variation of last years https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3[ Crossed Wires] which I solved last year with https://github.com/michael-simons/aoc/blob/master/2019/day03/java/Solution.java[plain java] (I would so use records today).

It would be boring to do this in another language, so I stick with databases. 
Part one is essentially the same as last year and my solution is actually very similar. 
I do keep track of the state changes in a recursive table definition.

Either run the statements above or run the whole script inside a database running in docker and execute `solution.sql`:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
docker run --name maria --volume=$(pwd):/aoc -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes -e MYSQL_USER=aoc -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret -e MYSQL_DATABASE=aoc -d mariadb:10.3
sleep 10
docker exec -w /aoc -it maria /bin/bash -c  "mysql -uaoc -psecret aoc --local-infile=1 < solution.sql"
docker rm --force maria
----

NOTE: Part 2 is missing (yet)

NOTE: Tested with `MariaDB-1:10.3.27`
      Correct solutions are: `757` and `n/a`.
