I think that has been the first https://www.php.net[PHP] I wrote in about 15 years or so.
Funny thing: It's also the program who gave be both golden stars this year at first try.

If you remember that most function have somewhat weird parameter orders, you can enjoy the ease of yolo checking string values for numeric values like this: `$passport['byr'] >= 1920 && $passport['byr'] <= 2002;` where `$passport` is an associative array containing `string => string`.

NOTE: Tested with `PHP 7.3.11 (cli)`.
      Run with: `php solution.php`.
      Correct solutions are: `237` and `172`.
