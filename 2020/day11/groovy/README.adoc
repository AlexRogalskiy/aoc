Game of Life way thing. 
Key is not to replace the seating on the go but on the whole thing at once.

Didn't have a fancy idea for star two but only went in all directions.

Run with `groovy Solution`

NOTE: Tested with `Groovy Version: 3.0.7 JVM: 1.8.0_275 Vendor: AdoptOpenJDK OS: Mac OS X`
      Correct solutions are: `2321` and `2102`. +
      +
      With JDK 9+ the `combinations` method used will issue a warning, which is not a bug 
      of this solution, but of Groovy in combination with newer JDKs.
