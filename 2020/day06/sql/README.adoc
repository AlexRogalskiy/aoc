:tags: CTE, SQL

Another database solution, this time with H2.
I "cheated" a bit and loaded the data via Groovy, therefor you need https://groovy-lang.org[Groovy] installed
to run it, but nothing more.

Schema contains three tables, `groups`, `people`, `answers`. 
Find them in the `Solution.groovy` script.

Run with `groovy Solution`

NOTE: Tested with `Groovy Version: 3.0.7 JVM: 15 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: Mac OS X`
      Correct solutions are: `7128` and `3640`.
