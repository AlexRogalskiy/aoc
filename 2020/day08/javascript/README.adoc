Yeah, my first JavaScript solution ;) 
No Java developer got hurt, though: Tested on https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM].

Run with

[source,bash]
----
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/node solution.js 
----

Plain node (tested with `v14.4.0`) is of course fine too.

NOTE: Tested with `GraalVM CE Native Polyglot Engine Version 20.3.0` providing Node `v12.18.4`
      Correct solutions are: `1563` and `767`.
