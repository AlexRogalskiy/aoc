= Advent of Code

As always, I'm late to the party and when I arrive, I cannot get enough.

In late 2019, my friend https://twitter.com/ralfdmueller[Ralf] asked me whether I want to participate both in https://adventofcode.com[Advent of Code] and on his community site https://aoc-2019.netlify.com[aoc2019].
My short answer was "No" due to time constraints and being focussed on other things in 2019 than extracurricular programming.

But than https://xkcd.com/356/[this] happened and it hit me real good.

I contributed all examples and accompanying READMEs for 2019 originally on Ralf's site. 
Please check it out, it's an outstanding community effort for Ralf.

My personal goal: Have some fun doing programming in various languages, learn and teach something new.

The folders are sorted by year, day and language.
